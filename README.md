# ProgrammerType

The typing test for developers with skill issues.

## How'd We Get Here?

<sarcasm>

Good question, I'm glad you asked. After finishing University I started working corporate. As any developer who has made
this change will know; I felt empty with the interpreted meaninglessness of what I was accomplishing. Of course, this
makes total sense! Building and maintaining cloud infrastructure that ensures the smooth operation of a real-world
business with real-world constraints, is COMPLETELY meaningless compared to building software applications that closely
fit artificial constraints and criteria.

As such, I sought out a way to satisfy this desire. This started with a change from JetBrains to VSCode (not by choice,
but my education-licence expired). When my skill issues with VSCode were sufficiently highlighted, I implemented the age
old "its because of the color scheme" approach. Once this stopped working, I stumbled across a YouTuber called
"ThePrimeagen". He was talking about going "blazingly-fast" with Neovim, and I said (and I quote) "ohhh, I would like to
go blazingly-fast". 2 years later, 181 commits to my Neovim configuration, 3 different keyboards, and here we are;
Building a web application to resolve problems you encounter when you reinvent the wheel.

## What is ProgrammerType?

ProgrammerType is a typing test application for keyboard-centric programmers. How does this application differ from
[MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com)?

| Description   | MonkeyType                                       | ProgrammerType                                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Aim           | Improve your ability to type words and sentences | Improve your ability to program and keyboard-navigate |
| Skills        | QWERTY, DVORAK, Keyboard Layouts                 | Special Characters and Keyboard Shortcuts             |
| Test Suites   | Words and Quotes                                 | Code and Actions                                      |
| Useful For    | Documentation writing                            | Programming and Keyboard-Centric actions              |
| Timed         | Yes                                              | Yes                                                   |
| Zen / Untimed | Yes                                              | Yes                                                   |

So, whilst there are certainly some parallels between these two applications (MonkeyType being a huge inspiration for
ProgrammerType), the aim for ProgrammerType differs in it's intention for what skill-set it intends users to focus on.

ProgrammerType was developed because I was having trouble quickly identifying issues with new keyboard layouts. I would
use MonkeyType to quickly identify any major issues, however, I often found that it wasn't until I attempted to program
with my new layout that I would actually identify most of the issues I hadn't accounted for; Consecutive special
characters and commonly used keyboard shortcuts (`Alt + Tab`, `Ctrl + Tab`, etc). ProgrammerType was primarily design as
a solution to this particular issue. It's ability to perform as a tool beyond this scope is viable, but not it's primary
purpose.
