# ProgrammerType

As a developer, I’ve been on a quest to find a keyboard that offers me the least resistance to programming. This journey
has taken me through various keyboard form factors and layouts, as well as different tools, all in pursuit of a seamless
keyboard-only setup. Despite my progress, one persistent challenge has been the testing and compatibility of new
layouts.

While there are numerous typing tests available online, I haven't found any that match the finesse of `Monkeytype.com`
that are tailored for programmers. `ProgrammerType` is designed to be a similar typing test to `Monkeytype`, but with a
focus on programming and keyboard-based navigation. Instead of words and paragraphs, users will encounter random code
snippets, navigation challenges, and command sequences. This allows developers to practice and refine their
keyboard-centric development skills in a realistic and practical context.

By integrating real-world programming scenarios and navigation tasks, `ProgrammerType` offers a unique approach to
typing tests. Whether you’re a seasoned developer looking to optimize your workflow or a beginner aiming to build strong
keyboard habits, `ProgrammerType` will help you achieve your goals.
