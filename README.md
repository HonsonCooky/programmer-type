# programmer-type

As a developer, I’ve been on a quest to find a keyboard that offers me the least resistance to programming. This journey
has taken me through various keyboard form factors and layouts, as well as different tools, all in pursuit of a seamless
keyboard-only setup. Despite my progress, one persistent challenge has been the testing and compatibility of new
layouts.

While there are numerous typing tests available online, I haven't found any that match the finesse of `Monkeytype.com`
that are tailored for programming. Programming often uses special characters, numbers, etc, and most common layouts do
not put these keys in easy reach.

`programmer-type` is designed to be a similar typing test to `Monkeytype`, but with a focus on programming and
keyboard-based navigation. Instead of words and paragraphs, users will encounter random code snippets, navigation
challenges, and command sequences. This allows developers to practice and refine their keyboard-centric development
skills in a realistic and practical context.

By integrating real-world programming scenarios and navigation tasks, `programmer-type` offers a unique and practical
approach to typing tests. Whether you’re a seasoned developer looking to optimize your workflow or a beginner aiming to
build strong keyboard habits, `programmer-type` will help you achieve your goals. Join me in this journey to create a
more efficient and enjoyable programming experience.
