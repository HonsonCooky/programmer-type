	<h3>Welcome</h3>
	<p>
		In the endless attempt to find a frictionless, keyboard centric, developer setup, I've created myself lot of extra
		work. This web app is one such solution to the issue of testing a keyboard layout's effectiveness in development
		based activities.
	</p>
	<h3>Keyboard Inputs</h3>
	<p>
		Designed with context-driven keyboard navigation in mind (kind of the whole point of the application). Turn off your
		Vimium and follow the bindings wrapped with braces <code>[X]</code>. Context-driven meaning that if some sub-menu is
		open, only keys from this menu will be valid next inputs; Anything else will reset the context. You can view the
		current key combination in the bottom right; Where *base* indicates that you have no context.<br />
		The buttons work too, but don't be expecting a flawless experience if you're jumping from mouse interactions to
		keyboard interactions.<br />
		- <code>Esc</code>: to reset the context.<br />
		- <code>:q</code>: to exit the text editor.<br /><br />

		You can also navigate with some Vim inspired commands.<br />
		- <code>Ctrl + d</code>: Scroll main area down<br />
		- <code>Ctrl + u</code>: Scroll main area up<br />
		- <code>j</code>: Hover next element of sub-menu<br />
		- <code>k</code>: Hover prev element of sub-menu<br />
		- <code>Enter</code>: Select hovered element of sub-menu<br />
	</p>
	<h3>Test Types</h3>
	<p>
		A keyboard layout's effectiveness goes beyond being able to just program. There is OS navigation, File Navigation,
		Web Searches and other common actions that a keyboard centric developer may want to test out. In the "Problem Set",
		you will find a range of different tests:

		<table>
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Type</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>Code</td>
					<td>
						Coding challenges are simple typing tests, but with programs instead of random words. New line characters
						are explicitly defined. Beware, word wrap is on.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Actions</td>
					<td>
						Action challenges require you to follow the instructions on screen, and enter in commands perfectly. Invalid
						inputs will reset the line. Completed lines may have some action associated with them, which will usually be
						explained in the comment above, but will also be be indicated as done with an additional comment added to
						the line.
