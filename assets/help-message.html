  <h3>Welcome</h3>
  <p>
    In the endless attempt to find a frictionless, keyboard centric, developer setup, I've created myself lot of extra
    work. This web app is one such solution to the issue of testing a keyboard layout's effectiveness in development
    based activities.
  </p>
  <h3>Keyboard Inputs</h3>
  <p>
    Designed with context-driven keyboard navigation in mind (kind of the whole point of the application). Turn off your
    Vimium and follow the bindings wrapped with braces <code>[X]</code>. Context-driven meaning that if some sub-menu is
    open, only keys from this menu will be valid next inputs; Anything else will reset the context. You can view the
    current key combination in the bottom right; Where *base* indicates that you have no context.<br />
    The buttons work too, but don't be expecting a flawless experience if you're jumping from mouse interactions to
    keyboard interactions.<br />
    - Press <code>Esc</code> to reset the context.<br />
    - Press <code>:q</code> to exit the text editor.
  </p>
  <h3>Test Types</h3>
  <p>
    A keyboard layout's effectiveness goes beyond being able to just program. There is OS navigation, File Navigation,
    Web Searches and other common actions that a keyboard centric developer may want to test out. In the "Problem Set",
    you will find a range of different tests:
  </p>
  <div>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Code</td>
          <td>
            Coding challenges are simple typing tests, but with programs instead of random words. New line characters
            are explicitly defined. Beware, word wrap is on.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Actions</td>
          <td>
            WIP: This unfinished test suite will have you jumping between your IDE and the web page; Completing actions
            like copy-paste, select 3 paragraphs, copy, paste in web app.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
