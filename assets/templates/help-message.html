  <h3>Welcome</h3>
  <p>
    In the endless attempt to find a frictionless, keyboard-centric developer setup, I've created myself lot of extra
    work. After purchasing my third "ergonomic" keyboard (and countless amounts of Neovim re-configurations),
    <code>programmer-type</code> was created to aid in streamlining this process. Initially designed to be a
    <a href="https://monkeytype.com/">MonkeyType</a> for developer related tasks, I've used this program for the
    following use cases.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>- Programming Typing Speed:</b> So you can type at 100wpm, but how does that translate to programming when
    brackets, braces and parentheses are thrown into the mix<br />
    <b>- Keyboard Layout Testing:</b> Purchasing a firmware programmable ergonomic keyboard is all the rage right now.
    You've probably purchased this keyboard under the promise of reduced<br />
  </p>
  <h3>Keyboard Inputs</h3>
  <p>
    Designed with context-driven keyboard navigation in mind (kind of the whole point of the application). Turn off your
    Vimium and follow the bindings wrapped with braces <code>[X]</code>. Context-driven meaning that if some sub-menu is
    open, only keys from this menu will be valid next inputs; Anything else will reset the context. You can view the
    current key combination in the bottom right; Where *base* indicates that you have no context.<br />
    The buttons work too, but don't be expecting a flawless experience if you're jumping from mouse interactions to
    keyboard interactions.<br />
    - <code>Esc</code>: to reset the context.<br />
    - <code> :q</code>: to exit the text editor.<br /><br />

    You can also navigate with some Vim inspired commands.<br />
    - <code>Ctrl + d</code>: Scroll main area down<br />
    - <code>Ctrl + u</code>: Scroll main area up<br />
  </p>
  <h3>Test Types</h3>
  <p>
    A keyboard layout's effectiveness goes beyond being able to just program. There is OS navigation, File Navigation,
    Web Searches and other common actions that a keyboard centric developer may want to test out. In the "Problem Set",
    you will find a range of different tests:
  </p>
  <div>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Type</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Code</td>
          <td>
            Coding challenges are simple typing tests, but with programs instead of random words. New line characters
            are explicitly defined. Beware, word wrap is on.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Actions</td>
          <td>
            Action challenges require you to follow the instructions on screen, and enter in commands perfectly. Invalid
            inputs will reset the line. Completed lines may have some action associated with them, which will usually be
            explained in the comment above, but will also be be indicated as done with an additional comment added to
            the line.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </div>
  <h3>Caching Tests</h3>
  <p>
    Down the bottom of your screen is a "Cache" checkbox for the local storage of test data. By unchecking this box, you
    will clear all local storage, and make requests for test data upon each new test. While the checkbox is checked,
    tests will only make a request on first load. You can "refresh" the tests by simply unchecking and rechecking this
    checkbox.
  </p>
  <h3>Potential Contributors</h3>
  <p>
    Hey all, I'm kinda assuming most people using this application are developers. I find my creative cup drained with
    this application. I don't know how to improve it further, nor have I tested this on every browser under the sun. So,
    if you've found an issue or have an idea, PRs are more than welcome. Issues "CAN" be created; But are more likely to
    be akin to a community notice board than a notification to exisiting contributors.
