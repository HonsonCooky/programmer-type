  <h3>Welcome</h3>
  <p>
    Ever felt like your keyboard is a mysterious artifact from an ancient civilization? Fear not, brave coder!
    <code>Programmer Type</code> is here to transform you into a keyboard wizard faster than you can say
    <span class="correct">‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù</span> Whether you‚Äôre looking to master new keyboard layouts, discover
    shortcuts that make your fingers dance, or simply want to test your programming typing speed, we've got you covered.
    Say goodbye to the days of hunting and pecking like a lost pigeon and hello to the era of lightning-fast, error-free
    typing! Join us on this epic quest to conquer the keyboard and become the ultimate typing legend! (Or maybe just
    reduce your skill issues).
  </p>

  <h3>Keyboard Inputs</h3>
  <p>
    This application is designed with context-driven keyboard navigation. Remember to disable Vimium and follow the key
    bindings indicated by braces <code>[X]</code>. Context-driven navigation meaning that when a sub-menu is open, only
    keys from that menu will be valid for the next inputs; any other key will reset the context. You can view the
    current key combination in the bottom right corner, where *base* indicates no active context. While the buttons are
    functional, switching between mouse and keyboard interactions may not provide a seamless experience.
  </p>

    <i>
      Future Developer Note: This style of keyboard input indicator is very basic. I've implemented "which-key" style
      navigation before (

        [B] Browser Home
      </a>
      ), but it seems a little excessive here as there's at most, two layers to any menu system. Should the need arise,
      this is an option.

  <h3>Suite Types</h3>
  <p>
    For keyboard centric developers, a keyboard layout's effectiveness goes beyond being able to enter a sequence of
    English characters. There is OS navigation, File Navigation, Web Searches, Special Characters and other common
    components that need to be considered and practiced.
  </p>
  <h4>Code Suites</h4>
  <p>
    Coding challenges are typing tests as you've seen them before. Attempt to correctly type out the sequence of
    characters on screen as fast as you can. The twist - character sequences are code snippets. The idea here is to
    test/practice your ability to use common programming character sequences. With that in mind, the following
    constraints have been implemented:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="correct">Indentation</span>: Automatic Indentation has been implemented. Each line will start at the
      first significant character.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="correct">New-Line Characters</span>: For UX reasons (font-size, screen-size, word-wrap) new line
      characters are explicitly defined by <code>\n</code>. You only need press Enter when encountering this symbol.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="incorrect">No Auto-Complete</span>: Your daily programming setup probably has some more tools that
      make you blazingly fast. That's not really what we are testing here though.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="incorrect">Limited Languages</span>: Your favourite language isn't in the mix?! OUTRAGEOUS! Keep in
      mind that we are testing/practicing character sequences. The available programming languages aim to cover a wide
      range of character sequences using as few test suites as possible. Less maintenance ü§∑.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Action Suites</h4>
  <p>
    Action challenges are more complicated tests that require you to follow the instructions on screen. This will likely
    require you to jump to another program or open a new tab. <code>Programmer Type</code> does not track your activity
    outside of this web application, so completing tasks as instructed will be up to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where required, you might be asked to simulate keyboard inputs from another program. Unlike Coding Challenges,
    incorrect inputs in these cases will reset the entire line. Accuracy is required here.
  </p>
  <p>
    Actions might require extra permissions from this web app. Access to your clipboard or file system might be
    required. Just bare this in mind as your browser might ruin your first attempt by asking for these permissions.
  </p>

  <h3>Caching Tests</h3>
  <p>
    Down the bottom of your screen is a "Cache" checkbox for the local storage of test data. By unchecking this box, you
    will clear all local storage, and make HTTP requests for every new test. If you tick the checkbox, test files will
    be stored in local storage upon first contact. If you find yourself constantly hit with a loading screen between
    tests, or have the storage on your device to reduce requests to the server, consider checking this box to reduce
    wait times.
  </p>

  <h3>Potential Contributors</h3>

  <p>
    I'm kinda assuming most people using this application are developers. To make this tool as universally helpful as
    possible, your ideas and contributions would be seriously appreciated! It's a pure <code>HTML</code>,
    <code>CSS</code> and <code>JavaScript</code> application running on GitHub pages. No <code>NPM</code> or other web
    frameworks.
  </p>
  <p>
    I work full-time, so the issues board might be more of a forum than something I actually manage and maintain.
    However, if you create a PR, I will be far more enthused to look into the changes you're wanting.
